<span class="font-light tracking-widest">Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our colleagues from Neurosurgery and Orthospine divisions, we've made this dream a reality. MSESS has brought together local and international experts in Endoscopic Spine Surgery to share their knowledge and expertise. We've also formed partnerships with renowned spinal surgery associations to expand our training, experience sharing, idea exchanging, and research collaborations.<br><br>

Join us for keynote lectures, workshops, panel discussions, and presentations, providing a valuable platform for learning, networking, and collaborations.
Thank you to all sponsors, exhibitors, speakers, and delegates for their unwavering support. We hope you have an informative and enjoyable experience.<br><br></span>
